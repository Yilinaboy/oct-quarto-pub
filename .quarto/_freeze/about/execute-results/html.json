Shall I regard them as Eastern Asian, Korean or Americans with Korean origin?\n\n### Problems for Searching Scholars' Age\n\nMost CV did not include scholars' birth year and I can only infer their age based on the first year they entered the University (17 or 18 years old). However, considering that some countries like Singapore mandate military services, it is really hard for me to give an accurate record of these scholars' age. Furthermore, many westerners take a gap year to travel abroad or even get as a part-time/full-time job before their univesrity, so it is still hard for me to correctly reflect female scholars' age. Finally, given that there is no explicit rules for age restriction in applying for a tenured position in North America, I just wonder if we may exclude age as a covariate in this case?\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# References\n",
